## Challenges
Like my last assignment, I had trouble with Git. At first, I could not get Git to work at all with my Github. I spent time troubleshooting and in the end what worked was deleting my old repository and creating a new one. I also had to use git push -f origin main a few times. It worked in the end but it was a big headache!

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score.
